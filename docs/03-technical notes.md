## Iterators

To avoid a possible large list of recipients are being generate ad-hoc during the
change detection process, there are two iterators that will resolve a list of
groups and subsequently its members on request.

The `UserLocator` is responsible for locating recipients of a notification event and
is being resolved using a `CallbackIterator` which is then added to the `RecursiveGroupMembersIterator`
to iteratively resolve a single group and its members during a recursive processing.

```
	// Find the groups related to changed properties
	$groups = $iteratorFactory->newCallbackIterator(
		$extra['properties'],
		$notificationGroupsLocator->getNotificationsToGroupListByCallback( $subSemanticDataMatch )
	);
```
```
	// Find the members that belong to each group
	$recursiveGroupMemberIterator = $iteratorFactory->newRecursiveGroupMembersIterator(
		$groups,
		$store
	);
```
```
	// Recursively resolve the previous steps
	$recursiveIteratorIterator = $iteratorFactory->newRecursiveIteratorIterator(
		$recursiveGroupMemberIterator
	);

	// Create a "real" User object on request only
	$callbackIterator = $iteratorFactory->newCallbackIterator( $recursiveIteratorIterator, function( $recipient ) {
		return User::newFromName( $recipient, false );
	} );
```

## Hooks

	 * false to suppress an event even though the normal process would have
	 * matched it
